> A key piece of interoperability is consistency between coding environment when moving from one machine to another. One way to achieve this consistency is to ensure your common configs such as your .bashrc/.zshrc files have been saved to a hosted location.

### Example
Here is an example of my own shared config repo: [https://github.com/nezhivar/shared-configs](https://github.com/nezhivar/shared-configs)

This gives me the flexibility to ensure that I can move from one environment to the next with minimal downtime with provided scripts. Aiming to create a seaming transition from one machine to the next.

### Why
Transition to a new environment or a new machine can be challenge and a time consuming process as you will have to either remember or research exactly how some was configured in your old machine in order to get a project to work. By creating a shared configs amongst all your machines, you will at least improve your transition time from one machine to the next

### Future State
I have configured it so far to be a manual process that I run occasionally. In the future, this could be setup through a monthly cronjob. Other configurations could be added as well such as VSCode settings and mac specific settings.
